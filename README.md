# Account-Manager

Manage accounts in a single file with passwords protected by a chosen keyword.

**No** liability held for any accounts that are stored incorrectly; this is still a work in progress.

### Notes for installation: 
* Currently downloaded as source code - to run program execute src/main.py
* To keep passwords after new versions copy accounts.txt into new the release's directory 
  (the aim is to make this a more seamless process in later releases).
